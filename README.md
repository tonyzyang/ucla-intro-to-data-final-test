# WELL DEFINED PROBLEM STATEMENT

**Domain of the problem**

This dataset used in Sam Waugh (1995) "Extending and benchmarking Cascade-Correlation", PhD thesis, Computer Science Department, University of Tasmania.

so this is the data set for exploring the correlations of different variables

**Problem**

Predict the age a abolone using the physical measurments. we regard rings as age.

**Data Set** 

There are 4176 rows and 9 columns. Variables are sex, length, Diameter, Height, Whole weight, Shucked weight, Viscera weight, Shell weight.

**Solution Statement**

A solution to this problem will be a multilinear regression model.

**Benchmark Model** 

The benchmark of this dataset could be a single variable prediction model(eg. only use variable length to do a simple linear model for predictiong the age.

**Performance Metric**
Using the correlation metric, and for regression model, we can use R square to see how the result the regression model perform.
